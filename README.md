## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a calculator that shows the annual salary of an employee on click.

The following should happen when using the tool.

1. Input data on the form. First Name, Last Name, Employee ID, Job Title & Annual Salary.
2. Upon click of "Calculate Annual Salary)", the table below should fill up with that information along with the annual salary of each employee.
3. If you want to delete a line, simply press delete at the end of the table row.
4. The total salary of all employees is listed at the bottom and should calculate the total amount of all employees' salaries, combined.

This project utilizes, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery to accomplish this task.

Known issues being resolved: Currently, on submission, the values are not appending to the table. They are appending on the query on the URL, but unfortunately, not the query. The current suspicion is that there is an issue with the for loop meant to loop through the array (where the needed content should be in order to be pushed to the DOM). Currently on load, there are no errors in the console, so there is likely a logic error that while working is not functioning as intended for this project.
